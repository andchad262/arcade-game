## Arcade Game

## Objective:

In this game you have a Player and Enemies (Bugs) in a Frogger application. The goal of the player is to reach the water without colliding into any one of the enemies. If you hit the enemies the game will reset. Be patient as it is possible to cross over without being hit. Once you successfully cross over you will get a point. However if you get hit by the evil bugs the score will reset to 0.

## How to play:

The player can move left, right, up and down using the arrowkeys. The enemies move in varying speeds on the paved block portion of the scene. Once a player collides with an enemy, the game is reset, and the player moves back to start. Player wins by reaching the water without any collisions. The game will then reset
